Emergency Hand Sign Recognition (Computer Vision)

Emergency Hand Sign Recognition using Computer Vision & MediaPipe

This project focuses on **real-time recognition of emergency hand signs** such as:
- 🔥 Fire Alert  
- 🏥 Medical Emergency  
- ⚠️ Violence Alert  
- 🚗 Brake Failure  

It uses **Computer Vision (CV)** techniques with **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection, enabling quick and efficient emergency sign recognition.

 Features
- 🎥 Real-time webcam-based hand sign recognition
- ✋ Detects specific emergency signs (fire, medical, violence, brake failure)
- 🧠 Uses **MediaPipe Hand Tracking** for high accuracy
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight (runs on CPU in real-time)
- 🔔 Can be extended to trigger alerts/notifications


Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe  
- **ML/DL Models (if extended)**: TensorFlow / PyTorch  

Usage:
Run the script → webcam opens
Show one of the emergency hand signs
The system recognizes and classifies the sign

Future implementation:
Trigger an alert system (SMS/IoT alarm/etc.)
